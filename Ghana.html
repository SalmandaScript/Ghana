<p>John Agyekum Kufuor, is a Ghanaian politician who served as the President of Ghana from 7 January 2001 to 7 January 2009. He also became the Chairperson of the African Union from 2007 to 2008 and his victory over John Evans Atta Mills after the end of Jerry Rawlings' second term marked the first peaceful democratic transition of power in Ghana since independence in 1957.
Kufuor's career has been spent on the liberal-democratic side of Ghanaian politics, in the parties descended from the United Gold Coast Convention and the United Party. As a lawyer and businessman, he was a minister in Kofi Abrefa Busia's Progress Party government during Ghana's Second Republic, and a Popular Front Party opposition frontbencher during the Third Republic.</p>
